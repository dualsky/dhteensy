* key representation:
 - KEY_3+0x80 if shift. Any other modifiers used by combos?
   Key codes go up to 99 so high bit can be used
   special keys: 0xff, 0xfe, etc?
             Aka 0x7f + 0x80
   use 0x70 to 0x7f perhaps (112-127) (+0x80 high bit)

* building keyboard_modifier_keys and keyboard_keys
 - zero out k_m_k and k_k
 - scan keyboard to find all keys currently down
 - walk through each pressed key:
   - look up key code and modifier code for key according to current
     mode
   - if key is 0xff etc then it's a special key, handle it
   - otherwise:
     - if key's high bit is on turn on shift in k_m_k
     - append key code to k_k
     - if we already have 6 keys break out of the loop, don't check for
       more
       - maybe do "phantom condition" by setting all of k_k to 0x01's
 - at the end of the loop |= state based modifier to k_m_k
 - call usb_keyboard_send

 - k_k and k_m_k might be sent out from irq if a get report request
   comes in. Maybe update it only in cli()?

* special key combo to call reload()
